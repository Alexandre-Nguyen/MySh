# MySh
A very basic imitation of a shell

First, use the command: make
Then, execute the program with the command: ./mysh

You can now use linux commands like: ls, echo, cd, etc...

Use the command "exit" to quit the program
WARNING: Sometimes, the command "exit" doesn't work the first time 

The program can use multiple command with ';'
For exemple: ls -l; echo "test"; ls -a

The program can use the pipe, but you can use only one pipe
For exemple: ls | wc
